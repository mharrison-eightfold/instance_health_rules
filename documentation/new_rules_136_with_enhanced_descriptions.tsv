What It Checks
Verifies that custom_fields_v2 > application > reason is configured in your Integration System
Ensures the mapping correctly extracts rejection reason data from your source ATS
Why It Matters
Proper configuration of the application.reason field is critical for:
Talent Analytics & Reporting
Rejection reason data populates the rejection_reason field in the Data Warehouse (Application table)
Powers analytics dashboards and hiring funnel reports
Enables rejection reason trend analysis over time
AI Model Training
Rejection reasons are used in Outcome Data classification
Helps distinguish between ""not screened"" vs ""not qualified"" rejection types
Improves candidate scoring and recommendation accuracy
Workflow Automation
Enables rejection reason-based triggers in Workflow Automation Center
Allows custom actions based on specific rejection reasons
Supports compliance and auditing requirements
Candidate Experience
Proper tracking ensures rejection reasons are available for candidate communications
Maintains historical context for re-applications
Impact of Missing Configuration
